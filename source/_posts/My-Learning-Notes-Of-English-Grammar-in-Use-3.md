### 1.Present perfect continuous(I have been doing)

We use the present perfect continuous for an activity that has recently stopped or just stopped.There is a connection with now:

```
Paul is very tired.He's been working very hard.(he's tired now)
```

We also use the present perfect continuous for an activity that has started but has not finished yet.For example:

```
How long have you been learning English?(you're still learning English)

Tim is still watching television.He's been watching television all day.

It has been raining for two hours.
```

You can use the present perfect continuous for actions repeated over a period of time:

```
Debbie is a very good tennis player.She's been playing since she was eight.

Every morning they meet in the same cafe.They've been going there four years.
```

##### Compare *present continuous* and *present perfect continuous*:

Present continuous is used for an activity that happening now.Present perfect continuous is used for an activity that has started but maybe has not ended yet or just stoped.

##### Compare *present perfect continuous* and *present perfect*

When we use the present perfect continuous,we are interested in the activity.It does not matter whether something has been finished or not.

But when we use the present perfect,we are interested in the result of the activity,not in the activity itself.

```
My hands are dirty.I've been repairing the car.

The car is OK again now.I've repaired it.
```

We use the present perfect continuous to ask or say how long,and we use the present perfect to ask or say how much,how many or how many times:

```
How long have you been reading that book?

Mary is still writing letters.She's been writing letters all day.

How many pages of that book have you read?

Mary has written ten letters today.
