### 1.Past simple(I did)

Very often the past simple ends in -ed:

```
I invited them to our party but they decided not to come.
```

Many verbs are irregular.Here are a list of irregular verbs:

In questions and negatives we use did/didn't + infinitive:

```
They didn't invite her to the party,so she didn't go.
```

Note that we do not use did in negatives and questions with was/were:

```
Was the weather good when you were on holiday?
```

### 2.Past continuous(I was doing)

We use the past continuous to say that somebody was in the middle of doing something at a certain time.The action or situation had already started before this time but had not finished.

```
This time yesterday I was making love with my lover.
```

We often use the past simple and the past continuous together to say that something happened in the middle of something else:

```
I ejaculated when she was sucking my cock.
```

### 3.Present perfect(I have done)

The present perfect simple is **have/has + past participle**

When we use the present perfect there is always a connection with now.The action in the past has a result now:

```
He told me his name but I've fogotten it.
```

You can use the present perfect with just, already and yet.

* just = "a short time ago":

```
 Hello.Have you just arrived?
```

* already = something happened sooner than expected:

```
'What time is Mark leaving?' 'He's already gone.'
```

* Yet = 'until now' and shows that the speaker is expecting something to happen.Use yet only in questions and negative sentences:

```
Has it stopped raining yet?

I've written the letter but I haven't posted it yet.
```

Note the difference between gone(to) and been(to):

```
Jim is away on holiday.He has gone to Spain.(=he is there now or on his way there)

Jim is back home from holiday now.She has been to Italy.(=she has now come back from Italy)
```

In the following examples the speakers are talking about a period that continues until now(recently / in the last few days / so far / since breakfast):

```
Have you heard from George recently?

I've met a lot of people in the last few days.

We haven't had any problems so far.
```

We use the present perfect with **today / this moning / this evening** etc. when these periods are not finished at the time of speaking:

```
I've drunk four cups of coffee today.

Have you had a holiday this year(yet)?

I haven't seen Tom this morning. Have you?
```

Note that we say 'It is the first time something has happened'.For example:

```
It's the first time Tom has driven a car.(He has never driven a car before.)

This is a lovely meal.It's the first good meal I've had for ages.
```
