### 1.Present continuous

**I am doing** something

It means：I am doing now，at the time of speaking.The action is not finished.For example:

```
Please don't make so much noise.I'm working.
```

But the action is not necessarily happening at the time of speaking.For example:

```
I'm reading an interesting book at the moment.I'll lend it to you when I've finished it.
```

We use the present continuous when we talk about things happening in a period around now(for example:today/ this week/ this evening etc.):

```
You are working hard today.
```

We use the present continuous when we talk about changes happening around now:

```
The population of the world is rising very fast.
```

### 2.Present simple

We use the present simple to talk about things in general.We are not thinking only about now.We use it to say that something happens all the time or repeatedly,or that something is true in general.It is not important whether the action is happening at the time of speaking.For Example:

```
* Nurses look after patients in hospitals.
* I usually go away at weekends.
```

We use do/does to make questions and negative sentences:

```
* I come from Canada.Where do you come from?
* He's so lazy.He doesn't do anything to help me.
```


### 3.Present continuous and present simple

##### I always do and I'm always doing

Usually we say 'I always do something'(=I do it every time):

```
I always go to work by car.
```

You can also say "I'm always doing something",but this has a different meaning.It means that I do something too often,more oftem than normal.For example:

```
John is never satisfied.He's always complaining.
```
